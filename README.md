Here is a list of functionalities for an accommodation booking app:
Room booking: Allows users to search for available rooms based on preferences such as location, price, room type, number of guests, etc. 
Photo gallery and descriptions: The app should present a photo gallery of rooms so that users can see, what a given object looks like. There should also be a description available that includes information about amenities, cancellation policy, etc. 
Ratings and Reviews: Users should be able to view ratings and reviews from other guests to assess the quality and trustworthiness of the property. They can also add reviews themselves after their stay.
Notifications and Confirmations: Users should receive booking confirmations and other important notifications regarding their stay, such as check-in and check-out information.
